## Progress Log

### Current Status:

Summary of the Problem I was trying to fix:

The initial problem was that the safecopy.test.ts tests were failing with three specific errors:

1. overwrite strategy overwrites if destination exists (AssertionError: content not overwritten)
2. renameWithTilde strategy renames destination if it exists (FSError: File stats have not been read)
3. renameWithNumber strategy renames destination if it exists (FSError: File stats have not been read)

My Diagnosis of the Root Cause:

The core issue was a recursive call to util.safeCopy within FSSpecBase.copyTo.

- srcFile.safeCopy(destFile, opts) calls safeCopy(srcFile, destFile, opts).
- safeCopy then calls safeCopyFile(srcFile, destFile, opts).
- safeCopyFile then calls src.copyTo(fsDest.path, { ... }).
- Crucially, src.copyTo (which is FSSpecBase.copyTo) was also calling util.safeCopy, leading to an infinite recursion or
  at least incorrect behavior where the low-level copy was never actually performed directly.

My Attempted Solutions and Why They Failed (and led to confusion):

1. Initial Refactoring of `safeCopyFile`: I tried to refactor safeCopyFile to handle conflict resolution directly,
   removing the call to fsDest.backup(). This was a good idea in principle, but it was still operating under the
   assumption that FSSpecBase.copyTo was a low-level copy.
2. `FileSpec.backup()` and `_info` invalidation: I tried to fix FileSpec.backup() and invalidate _info to address the
   "File stats have not been read" error. This was a symptom, not the root cause.
3. TypeScript Errors: My attempts to modify import statements and type casts led to TypeScript errors, further
   complicating the situation.
4. Misunderstanding `dfs.copy` vs `nfs.copyFile`: I initially proposed using dfs.copy, then corrected to nfs.copyFile
   based on project guidelines, but my implementation details for nfs.copyFile were still being refined.
5. `replace` tool misuse: My repeated failure to accurately construct old_string for the replace tool led to failed
   operations and further confusion about the actual state of the files.
6. Inadvertent removal of `walk` import: In one of my replace attempts, I inadvertently removed the walk import, which
   is still needed by safeCopyFolder. This was a critical error on my part.
